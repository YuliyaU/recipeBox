# recipeBox with localStorage API

Free Code Camp assignment on Data Visualization to develop a recipe book REST based React app using a mock API that is generated with `json-schema-faker` and uses `json-server` as a back-end side. The state of the app is controlled with Redux.

The look of the app you can see in the [Demo](https://codepen.io/YuliyaU/full/aYVyPW/) that uses `localStorage` as an API.
